# WinimationOS
WinimationOS is an open-source operating system that build from scratch without anything, it's not a normal operating system because the emulator of an operating system is built before the actual operating system itself, and this is an emulator, not an actual os.

# Where does the name come from?
The name 'WinimationOS' comes from 'Windows' operating system and the word 'Animation' and mix together to get 'Winimation' and then add 'OS'.

# How to emulate/run the operating system?
First, open Eclipse IDE or other IDE if you preferred, then open the 'winimation-os' project, and then run, the entry point is 'com.khopan.winimation.WinimationOS:main(String[])' that launches the bootloader and then the bootloader is gonna load the kernel and then graphics stuff.
